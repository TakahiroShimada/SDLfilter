Description: Functions to filter GPS and/or Argos locations, as well as assessing sample sizes for the analysis of animal distributions. The filters remove temporal and spatial duplicates, fixes located at a given height from estimated high tide line, and locations with high error as described in Shimada et al. (2012) <doi:10.3354/meps09747> and Shimada et al. (2016) <doi:10.1007/s00227-015-2771-0>. Sample sizes for the analysis of animal distributions can be assessed by the conventional area-based approach or the alternative probability-based approach as described in Shimada et al. (in prep).
