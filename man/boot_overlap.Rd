\title{Bootstrap overlaps between Utilisation Distributions (UDs)}
\usage{
boot_overlap(
  data,
  R = 1000,
  method = "PHR",
  percent = 100,
  quantiles = c(0.25, 0.5, 0.75)
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A matrix or list of RasterLayer objects. 
Each row of the matrix or each RasterLayer object contains utilisation distribution 
(or other statistics that sums to 1 - e.g. proportion of time spent).
\bold{The grid size and geographical extent must be consistent across each row of the matrix or each RasterLayer object.}
The function assumes that each column of the matrix is associated with a unique geographical location or 
that each RasterLayer has exactly the same geographical extent and resolution.}

\item{R}{An integer specifying the number of iterations.}

\item{method}{The overlap quantification method. 
"HR" is for the proportion of an individual's home range overlapped by the known habitats of other individuals. 
"PHR" is for the probability of an individual to be within the known habitats of other individuals. 
"VI", "BA" and "UDOI" quantify overlap between UDs using the full probabilistic properties as described in Fieberg and Kochanny (2005). 
For the latter three options, the function calculates overlaps between each additional UD and a collective UD. 
To generate a collective UD, each UD is overlaid and averaged at each grid cell so the probability density of the collective UD sums up to 1 (Shimada et al. in prep).}

\item{percent}{An integer specifying the percent volume of each UD to be considered in the analysis.}

\item{quantiles}{A vector or a number to specify the quantiles to be calculated in the summary of the results.}
}
\value{
A list containing two data frames - raw results and summary (mean, sd, sem and quantiles at each sample size).
}
\description{
Function to calculate overlaps between UDs relative to sample size by bootstrapping.
}
\details{
This function calculates and bootstraps overlap between UDs based on the areas ("HR"), 
areas of collective UDs and the probability distribution of each individual ("PHR"), 
or the probability distribution of an individual and an averaged probability distribution of collective individuals ("VI", "BA", "UDOI").
